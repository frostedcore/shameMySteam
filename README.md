# shameMySteam

Grabs the games  you've played for less than 100 hours and shames you because you should feel bad.
Written in Python as a quick project.

TODO:
- Export in HTML to allow clickable links to games.
- Add better itteration of games because what I did here is disguisting and I should feel bad too.

To use run with python3.8 and supply your profile link. (ex: https://steamcommunity.com/id/<yourSteamNameHere>/
  
Feel Free to add to this dumpster fire.

Love,
Garrett
