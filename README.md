# shameMySteam

Grabs the games  you've played for less than 100 hours and shames you because you should feel bad.
Written in Python as a quick project.

TODO:
- Export in HTML to allow clickable links to games.
- Add better itteration of games because what I did here is disguisting and I should feel bad too.
